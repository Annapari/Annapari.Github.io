## Eat My Lunch

We are a New Zealand based Social Enterprise that makes and distributes lunches with a **‘Buy one, give one’** business model.

Create your account, select your order and for each purchase made *Eat my lunch* will provide and deliver a free school lunch to a kiwi kid that may otherwise go without!
